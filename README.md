The gist of this project is to create a food bank log where people can donate food, people can take food, and it will
eventually take distance into consideration by utilizing Google Maps. All data will then be saved to a file.

Here is what the program will be capable of:
- Allowed to donate food with quantity and enter the family name
- Be allowed to check all current donation entries
- be allowed to take food
  - utilize google maps
  - find distance to closest food bank and check whether the food bank has the required food
- Then you can exit, and all data is saved to a file
